## Goal
Align README expectations with reality by documenting unimplemented features and adding a roadmap section.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A roadmap section is added with near-term fixes.
- [ ] No new features are described beyond the audit recommendations.

## Context
Priority 4.1 from `.agent-info/audits/llmmux-audit.md`. Documentation currently over-promises. Update README to set accurate expectations.

## Expected Outputs
- README updates reflecting caveats and roadmap.

## Agent Prompt
Read `.agent-info/audits/llmmux-audit.md` Priority 4.1 and update README to note unimplemented features and add a roadmap section. Keep statements aligned with the audit only.
